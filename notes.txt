ContactMe.js
  Our state hooks for the ContactMe component are messy,
  Let's rename them and clean them up.


We want our dial







open email dialog -- check!

make sure all fields are filled -- 

trigger loading component

wait for email confirmation

trigger snackbar (one for confirmed, 
                  one for not confirmed)







QUESTIONS

what even is a reducer?
======
A reducer is a function used to manage state across multiple react-components
In order to [fw a reducer] you need to dispatch an action, which has a data 
payload (a string, a number, an object, &c.), and an action description (to 
uniquely identify it.)

what even is a saga
======
saga is a thread in our react-app that is intended to deal solely w/ side-
effects.

a function has a side effect if it changes some state variable outside of the
functions local environment, or rather that the function has an observable
effect outside of returning a value to what invoked the function.
e.g.
modifying a non-local variable
modifying a mutable argument passed by reference (??)

saga is a middleware tool within redux that can be called from any components
we make it available to, which allows us to dispatch redux actions, 

what even is axios / AJAX?
