Howdy, welcome to my little website repository!

I designed this website "from scratch" (as much as that's even a thing, c.f. Carl Sagan)
using the create-react-app environment / node-package-manager command.

Besides being a little bit of a showcase of my front-end skills to date, this is also
intended as a repository for both myself and others who have had a similar learning path
(i.e. Prime Digital Academy) to reference, should we need a little reminder on what all of
these different lines of code that you need in a React app are for!

I've done my best (or worst?) to comment every unique line of code that I can, with comments
being ommitted when redundant (in basically alphabetical order -- i.e. you will find more
comments with greater detail in files or components that with an alphabetical precedent).
Naturally, since this repo is a reference for my own use first, I wrote these comments in a way
that was most intuitive for me to understand -- this is _not_ to say that the comments are
written intuitively! I did my absolute best to use appropriate and specific terminology (pulled
from the documentation for whatever technology being commented on), rather than more "human"
terminology (with exceptions typically being placed within scare-quotes or other indicating marks).
I believe this is beneficial, since after all, we all have our own unique language that we use
to understand the world (c.f. Wittgenstein), and it can be really messy when we're trying to talk
about concrete, reproducible, and/or technical things without some sort of common language.
Thanks to all of the great writers of documentation out there who have made this an easier situation!!

Some notable features...

Getting the app running...



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
