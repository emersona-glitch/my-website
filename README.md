Howdy, welcome to my little website repository!

I designed this website "from scratch" (as much as that's even a thing, c.f. Carl Sagan)
using the create-react-app environment / node-package-manager command.

Besides being a little bit of a showcase of my front-end skills to date, this is also
intended as a repository for both myself and others who have had a similar learning path
(i.e. Prime Digital Academy) to reference, should we need a little reminder on what all of
these different lines of code that you need in a React app are for!

As I work through this project, I'm doing my best (or worst?) to comment every unique line of code that I can, with comments
being ommitted when redundant (in basically alphabetical order -- i.e. you will find more
comments with greater detail in files or components that with an alphabetical precedent).
Naturally, since this repo is a reference for my own use first, I wrote these comments in a way
that was most intuitive for me to understand -- this is _not_ to say that the comments are
written intuitively! I did my absolute best to use appropriate and specific terminology (pulled
from the documentation for whatever technology being commented on), rather than more "human"
terminology (with exceptions typically being placed within scare-quotes or other indicating marks).
I believe this is beneficial, since after all, we all have our own unique language that we use
to understand the world (c.f. Wittgenstein), and it can be really messy when we're trying to talk
about concrete, reproducible, and/or technical things without some sort of common language.
Thanks to all of the great writers of documentation out there who have made this an easier situation!!

talk a little bit about security and git / github, and what you'll need to do to spin up your own
website dingus.

More to come soon ;-)
